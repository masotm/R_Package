Description: The user, with this package, has a pool of functions that will run for him two different typology of trading strategies (Momentum and BAB) on time series given in input with the possibility to code a user made strategy. In addition the user has also the chance to backtest the builded strategy and get some useful statistics.

Guide To Create User-Personal-Function:
>fuser <-function(date,prices,freq,holdingperiod, "other eventual argument used for the statistic"){ 
  retper<- f.rendperc(prices)  #make the return if needed
  
  r<- estimateextractor(retper,holdingperiod,freq)

  d<- estimateextractor(date[-1],holdingperiod,freq)

  da<-d[[1]][length(d[[1]])] 
  estimation <-Stat(r[[1]])  #use any statistics applied to every column of the first element of the list
  for (i in 2:length(d)) {
    da<-c(da,d[[i]][length(d[[i]])])
    estimation <-rbind(estimation , Stat(r[[1]]) ) 
  }

  l<-list(beta,da)
  names(l)<-c("mtx","date") 
  return(l) 
#the return is a list with time series of the chosen statistics for every row that 
#corresponds to a different asset
}

#finally you can test your strategy with the function
backtestfunction(prices, date, f = fuser, percentile = percentile , freq = freq, holdingperiod = holdingperiod , long = T , short = T, other eventual argument used for the statistic = x, revert = T ) #use revert
